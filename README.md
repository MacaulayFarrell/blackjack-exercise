## Overview
### Brief
To create a Help Queue Spring Boot Application with full CRUD functionality, with 3 additional features from a list provided 

### Requirements
### Our Approach
The additional features we have decided to implement as a team are as follows:
- Solutions - so users can add solutions to a ticket. All solutions will be stored in a separate database.  
- Urgency - so a level of urgency can be assigned to a ticket, based upon value stored in an urgency field in the ticket table
- Topics - so topics can be assigned to tickets, based upon a field stored in a topic field in the ticket table.
